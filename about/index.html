                        <p>
                            At Cerebra ML, we believe all students deserve access to high-quality education without financial barriers. Our mission is to empower middle and early high school students with a solid foundation in machine learning and artificial intelligence through free, accessible resources and programs. The challenge is clear: premium courses like those on Coursera are expensive, while free options are often too technical for younger learners. As high school juniors who have faced these struggles firsthand, we are committed to creating resources that are accessible, practical, and tailored to the needs of younger students.

I started with Andrew Ng’s Machine Learning Specialization, where I learned to implement techniques such as gradient descent, anomaly detection, and neural networks. My main project, Vocalize, is an app that uses generative transformers to help mute individuals communicate more effectively. This project has received $10,000 in funding from Z Fellows ( < 1% acceptance rate), and $2500 as a state finalist in the Samsung Solve for Tomorrow competition. Currently, I’m conducting research in exoplanetary systems at CSULB, and am eager to use machine learning to investigate further.</p>
